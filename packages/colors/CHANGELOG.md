  Added description field to package.json to better communicate that @xaui/colors is a TypeScript colors list utility inspired by Tailwind CSS color palette with 20+ color families and 11 shades each (50-950).

### Patch Changes

- 126894c: Rename package scope from @xui to @xaui

  The @xui npm scope was already taken, so all packages have been renamed to use the @xaui scope instead. This is a breaking change in terms of package name, but the API remains unchanged.
